Edson has met with Carolina, one of our customers. Carolina has explained some of the aspects from the application she would like to see being implemented.

A description of the interview can be found below:

Customer Call #1: Carolina

Customer Description: Carolina is a 20 year-old medical student currently living in Brazil. She is an animal lover and currently has 13 dogs with 2 living with her. 

Big stories:
Energy Bar: Profiles should include an “energy bar” that illustrates the energy level of the dog. This is of great value to our customer as they are an active individual who would like to adopt a dog that matches their energy level. 
Dog Size: Our customer would like us to add the dog’s size on the dog’s profile so they know how big the dog is and if they will be a good match for our customer. 
Sponsorship: For customers like Carolina, who are animal lovers,  we will be adding a sponsor feature which will allow them to sponsor dogs they are unable to adopt. 


Jan 19, 2024

The team has met with Adrian, our second customer. Adrian is a 19-year old urban planning student currently living in Toronto. He is an animal lover and is looking to adopt a dog to keep him company. 

The Big Stories proposed by Carolina have been proposed to Adrian who agreed on the proposals.
